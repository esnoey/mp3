Problem Statement: Are sequels more common today than they used to be?

```{r}
# find any movies that are denoted sequels by the use of "2"
db %>%
  dbGetQuery("SELECT * 
            FROM title
            WHERE kind_id IN (1,3)
            AND title LIKE '%_ 2';")
```

```{r}
# find any movies that are denoted sequels by the use of "3"
db %>%
  dbGetQuery("SELECT * 
            FROM title
            WHERE kind_id IN (1,3)
            AND title LIKE '%_ 3';")

```

```{r}
#JOIN title with movie_link table table and filter by movies that are sequels (follows)
db %>%
  dbGetQuery("SELECT *
            FROM imdb.movie_link ml
            JOIN title t ON ml.linked_movie_id = t.id
            WHERE ml.link_type_id = 1
            AND kind_id IN (1,3);")
```
